            <h3>General Information </h3>
            <p>
                The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing
                Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play hockey. To be a
                member of MDHL, you must be between the ages 4 to 12 and reside a Chicago northside
                neighborhood.
                MDHL ran
                by o small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of
                parents and previous league members.
